# Presentations for Final project

Unlike previous Project presentations this one **requires** that you plan and practice your presentation before hand.


## Time

You will have **exactly** 15 minutes. At the 14 minute mark, we'll signal to you to wrap up.

## What are you presenting?

Your Github issue should include links to:
1. Your portfolio repo and where your portfolio is deployed
2. Your mini-project repo(s) and where your mini project is deployed
3. Your main project repo(s) and where your main project is deployed

Your presentation will focus on your Final Project! You'll quickly show us your mini project and what it does and then transition to your main app.

Please share a link to your GitHub issue in the slack channel at the **start of your presentation.** This way we can all follow along, look at your code, play with your project, check out your portfolio as you present.

## PLAN AND PRACTICE!

This is important because you do not want to spend more than minute on your mini-project as it will take away time from the rest of your presentation.

**Do not** wing it! This is your final presentation in WDIR, and we might have some visitors from other classes watching, and you have a ton of content to show.

Think about what you're going to present, what points you're going to talk about, and then _practice_. Time yourself to make sure you can get all your information and demonstration across in ~10 - 12min, so you have time for some Q&A.

### Points to consider talking about

- What technologies did you use?
- What are you most proud of?
- What was the most complicated bug you ran into and how did you solve it?
- What technologies did you implement that were beyond the scope of what we taught you in WDI?
- If you used a 3rd party api, explain what it does, and how and why you're using it.


### Timing Recommendations

- 1 - 2 minutes demonstrating your mini-project
- 2 - 4 minutes demonstrating your main app on Heroku: From login to full crud flow
  - You should have test Users and test Data built before hand
- 3 - 4 minutes talking about what you're most proud of in your code
- 2 minutes talking about your challenges, what you might do differently, what you hope to do in the future.
- ~ 5 minutes for Q and A

Because your presentation time is limited plan consciously and pick what features and aspects you want to talk about.

### Participants!
**Presenting is a two-way street**

Those of you who are watching the presentation to write your own comments on the issue. Either asking questions about parts of the code, pointing out aspects of the project you like, etc.

You could offer constructive advice as well, but if you do be **mindful and respectful**.
